### Day 7 - Methods / Functions
**Date:** 03-Feb-2026
## 1️ Methods / Functions (Core)
A method is a block of statements that performs a specific task.
It helps in code reusability, modularity, and readability.
## Types of Methods
Predefined Methods – Already available in Java (e.g., math functions).
User-defined Methods – Created by the programmer.
## Based on parameters and return type:
No parameter, no return value
Parameter, no return value
Return value, no parameter
Return value with parameter
## Important Concepts:
Method Overloading – Same method name with different parameters.
Static Method – Belongs to class.
Non-static Method – Belongs to object.
Pass by Value – Java passes copy of variable.
Recursion – Method calling itself.
## 2️ Java Date & Time API
Introduced in Java 8 under java.time package.
## Features:
Date arithmetic (add/subtract days, months, years)
Formatting and parsing
Comparing dates
## 3️ Recursion
Recursion is a process where a method calls itself.
## Key Components:
Base Case – Condition to stop recursion.
Recursive Call – Method calls itself with smaller input.
## 4️ Random Class
The Random class is used to generate random values.
It can generate: Random integers , Random double values , Random boolean values
## 5️ String Processing
String processing means performing operations on text data.
Common Operations: Finding length , Extracting characters , Comparing strings , Searching substring , Replacing characters , Splitting strings , Changing case (upper/lower) , 
## 6️ Mathematical Logic
Mathematical logic includes solving number-based problems using conditions and loops.
